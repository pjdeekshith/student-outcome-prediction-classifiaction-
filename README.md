# student-outcome-prediction-classifiaction-Student Outcome Prediction – Classification

This project predicts student outcomes (such as Pass/Fail or performance category) using machine learning classification models. The goal is to analyze student data, clean it, visualize patterns, train models, and compare their performance.

⭐ Objective

To build a machine learning model that can accurately predict student outcomes based on academic, demographic, and behavioral features.

🔧 Models Used

This project uses two classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Both models are trained, tested, and compared using common evaluation metrics.

🗂️ Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Normalized numerical features

Outlier removal

Train–Test splitting

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation heatmap

Feature distributions

Relationship graphs

Boxplots for outlier detection

3. Model Training

Logistic Regression as baseline

Random Forest for improved accuracy

Hyperparameter tuning (if applied)

4. Model Evaluation

Metrics used:

Accuracy Score

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

📊 Results (Example – Update with yours)
Model	Accuracy	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	0.82	0.79
Random Forest	0.90	0.88

Random Forest performed better due to its ability to handle non-linear data and feature interactions.
